<span style="color:white">**GPG:** On Thursdays at 1 a.m. I hang out behind the bar whose logo contains two isosceles triangles. Whistle the theme song to The Office so I know it's you. If you can perform the secret handshake correctly, I'll hand you the broken remains of a 12th century druidic sword. Reforge the blade and brandish it in the light of a full moon--the digits of my GPG key will glow along its shaft in pale turqoise. We may then communicate securely.</span>
