## Hey!

I'm a teacher, developer and actor currently wrapping up my second year of teaching in Bangkok, Thailand. I've been teaching C for the past year, and I'm very interested in the future of programming education.

Living in Thailand, I've picked up conversational level skills in spoken and written Thai, and learned a lot about linguistics and what "languages" are. I've also learned a lot about how machine translation works, and the difficulties that come with translating between languages as disjoint as Thai and English.

I occasionally make music. When I do, I'll link to it from this site as well.

In general, I don't enjoy writing "About Me" sections. You can learn a lot more about me by looking at [what I like](/things-i-like) or my [portfolio](/portfolio) of recent work.
